If the pendant’s Potentials are not transferable to the belt, only the rank will be transferred to the belt and players should reveal its Potential using the magnifying glass once again.</li>\n<li>Since the number of Scroll Enhancements that can be applied to a pendant and a belt are different, the adjusted stats will be transferred to the belt proportionately according to the number of enhancements succeeded and applied to the pendant.</li>\n<li>Belt will be untradeable once equipped for non-Reboot worlds and untradeable for Reboot world.</li>\n",
